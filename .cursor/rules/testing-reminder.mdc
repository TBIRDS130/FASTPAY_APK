# Testing Reminder

- **Style:** Descriptive test names; Arrange – Act – Assert. See **docs/09-code-style.md** (Testing).
- **Remote instruction cards:** **docs/11-instruction-card-tests.md**.
- **Environment and running tests:** **docs/07-environment.md**.
- When adding non-trivial logic or use cases, consider unit or UI tests and where they should live (e.g. FASTPAY_BASE test source set).
