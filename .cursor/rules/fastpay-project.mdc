# FASTPAY_APK project root

- **Root:** `FASTPAY_APK` is the repo root. Paths, scripts, and docs assume this directory as the working root.
- **Versions:** Each FastPay app variant is a subfolder:
  - `FASTPAY_BASE` – base app (current release candidate)
  - Future versions (e.g. branded builds) go as sibling folders.
- **Build:** To build a version, run from repo root: `.\scripts\build-version.ps1` or `cd FASTPAY_BASE && .\gradlew assembleRelease`.
- **Style:** Use `.editorconfig` at repo root for Kotlin/XML/JSON consistency across all version folders.
