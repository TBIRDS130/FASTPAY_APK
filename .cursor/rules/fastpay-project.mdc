# FASTPAY_APK project root

- **Root:** `FASTPAY_APK` is the repo root. Paths, scripts, and docs assume this directory as the working root.
- **Docs:** Full documentation is in `docs/` – start at `docs/README.md` (overview, build, architecture, Django API, Firebase, remote commands, environment, keystore, code style, sync spec, instruction card tests, naming).
- **Versions:** Each FastPay app variant is a subfolder:
  - `FASTPAY_BASE` – base app (current release candidate)
  - Future versions (e.g. branded builds) go as sibling folders.
- **Build:** To build a version, run from repo root: `.\scripts\build-version.ps1` or `cd FASTPAY_BASE` then `.\gradlew.bat assembleRelease`.
- **Style:** Use `.editorconfig` at repo root for Kotlin/XML/JSON consistency across all version folders.

## Testing (debug build + device + logs)

- **Build and install on connected device:** From repo root run `.\scripts\test-debug.ps1` (or `.\scripts\test-debug.ps1 FASTPAY_BASE`). From `FASTPAY_BASE`: `.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug installDebug`.
- **View activation debug logs:** `adb logcat -s ActivationActivity:D`.
- **Full details:** See `docs/07-environment.md` (Cursor / Agent testing) or `ENVIRONMENT.md`.
